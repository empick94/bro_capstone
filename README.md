# bro_capstone

This repository contains deliverables for our MISM capstone project, including:

* Packet captures we generated of normal protocol behavior and attempted exploits
* Static alerts that we wrote for Zeek
* Jupyter notebooks for some of our machine learning work

The major processes, findings, and key learnings of our project are detailed in our project report.
